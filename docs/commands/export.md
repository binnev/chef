## Export

```shell
$ chef export
```

`yes-chef` will create the markdown recipes in the `<your-recipe-library>/md` folder. It will also generate a `README.md` file with an index of recipes, in your recipe library. The index has clickable links to the markdown recipe files, so you can easily browse recipes on your phone or tablet in the kitchen.
